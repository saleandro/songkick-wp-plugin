This plugin lets you display upcoming events for a Songkick user, artist, venue, or metro area on your WordPress blog, as a widget or shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you display upcoming events for a Songkick user, artist, venue, or metro area on your WordPress blog.

Events can be displayed by adding the Songkick widget to your template, or by adding the shortcode [songkick_concerts_and_festivals] anywhere in your blog.

= Features =

*   Upcoming events for an artist
*   Upcoming events for a venue
*   Upcoming events for a user
*   Upcoming events for a metro area. A metro area is a city or a collection of cities that Songkick uses to notify users of concerts near them.
*   Widget or shortcode format
*   Show events for multiple artists, users, venues, or metro areas.
*   Paginated list of events
*   Link to event locally or on Songkick
*   Can use custom templates from your theme
*   HTML markup with support for events as defined by [Schema.org](http://www.schema.org/)

= Requirements =

*   You'll need a Songkick API key. Apply for a key here: [Songkick API docs](http://www.songkick.com/developer)
*   This plugin requires PHP 5

= Settings =

Go to the Settings page to configure the plugin. 
*   For a user, simply put your username in the admin interface. 
*   For an artist, you should use the artist’s Songkick id, as shown in the url for your artist page. For example, the url "http://www.songkick.com/artists/123-your-name" has the id "123".
*   The same goes for metro areas: "http://www.songkick.com/metro_areas/123-city-name" has the id "123".
*   And venues: "http://www.songkick.com/venues/123-venue-name" has the id "123".

= Widget =

After configuring the plugin, go to the admin Widgets page and simply drag the widget into a sidebar.

= Shortcode =

After configuring the plugin, add the shortcode [songkick_concerts_and_festivals] in the content of any blog post.

When using a shortcode, you can set which artist, venue, metro area, or user you want to display events for, allowing you to show events for different entities:

*   Users:   `[songkick_concerts_and_festivals songkick_id=your_username songkick_id_type=user]`
*   Artists: `[songkick_concerts_and_festivals songkick_id=your_artist_id songkick_id_type=artist]`
*   Venues: `[songkick_concerts_and_festivals songkick_id=your_venue_id songkick_id_type=venue]`
*   Metro areas: `[songkick_concerts_and_festivals songkick_id=your_metro_area_id songkick_id_type=metro_area]`

You can also set the 'no_calendar_style=true' to remove the calendar style from the event dates.

= PHP code =

You can also call the shortcode method directly in your PHP code:
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[songkick_concerts_and_festivals]'); ?>`

= Customize Templates =

Copy the templates from the plugin template directory to your themes root directory. Modify to match your sites look and feel exactly.
